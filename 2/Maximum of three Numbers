Note: Do not use any inbuilt library to find the maximum and minimum value.


Input
Input:

The first line of input contains 3 space separated integers



Constraints:

1<= a <= 1000

1<= b <= 1000

1<= c <= 1000


Output
Output the maximum value among the three given integers


Sample Input 1 

11 3 17
Sample Output 1

17
Hint

Maximum value among 11, 3 and 17 is 17, so output is 17
