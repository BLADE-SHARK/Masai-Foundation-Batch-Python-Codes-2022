Description

Given three integers a , b, c , find whether they form the sides of theRight Angled Triangleor not, print "Yes" if they form the sides of the triangle else print "No"



For a triangle to be right angled triangle it must hold the Pythagoras Theorem i.e. ( a^2 + b^2 = c^2, if c is the hypotenuse of the triangle )

Note: If the input holds the necessary condition to be a triangle and right angled triangle then output "Yes" else output "No"


Input
Input:

The first line of input contains 3 space separated integers

Constraints:

1<= a <= 1000

1<= b <= 1000

1<= c <= 1000


Output
Output "Yes" or "No" , depending upon the answer.


Sample Input 1 

3 4 5
Sample Output 1

Yes
Sample Input 2 

3 4 6
Sample Output 2

No
Hint

In Sample 1:
3^2+4^2 = 25 = 5^2,  also it holds the necessary condition for being a triangle,  So output will be Yes

In Sample 2:

3^2+4^2 is not equal to 6^2 , so output will be No
