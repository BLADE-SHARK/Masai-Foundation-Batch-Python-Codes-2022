Description

Given 2 integersa, band characterc, output the mathematical operation between a and b based upon the operator c.

c can be ( +, -, *, / )

e.g.

2 * 3, then output will be 6, it means 2 is multiplied with 3

6 / 4 , then output will be 1, it means 6 is divided by 4 ( also it is an integer division )


Input
The first line of input contains a, c, b where 'a' and 'b' are integers and 'c' is a character ( operator )



Constraints:

1<= a <= 100

1<= b <= 100

c = {+, -, *, / }


Output
Output the result after mathematical operation between a and b


Sample Input 1 

2 * 3
Sample Output 1

6
Hint

In Sample 1:

We multiplied 2 and 3 , so output is 6
