Description

The set of positive numbers starting from1are known asNatural Numbers

The sum of firstNnatural numbers is given by the formula[N * (N + 1)] / 2

For example, given a number 5, the sum of first 5 natural numbers will be[5 * (6)]/2 = 15

You are given a number, stored in the variable with the name,number

Find the sum of natural numbers from 1 to the value stored in the variablenumber


Input
The first and the only line of the input contains the number, stored in the variablenumber

Constraints

1 <= N <= 50


Output
Print a single integer denoting the sum of natural numbers from 1 to the number stored in the variablenumber


Sample Input 1 

3
Sample Output 1

6
Hint

In the sample test case, the value stored in the variablenumberis 3. Therefore, using the formula given in the problem statement, the sum becomes

[N * (N + 1)]/2 = [3 * (3 + 1)]/2 = 12/2 = 6, which is the required answer.
