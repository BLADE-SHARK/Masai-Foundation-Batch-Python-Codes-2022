Description

Given three integers A, B and C. Find the value of the expression Expression = (A * B) + C


Input
The first and the only line of the input contains A, B and C.

Constraints

1 <= A, B, C <= 30


Output
Print the value of the expression of (A * B) + C


Sample Input 1 

3 4 5
Sample Output 1

60
Hint

In the given sample test case, A = 3, B = 4, C = 5. Therefore, the value of A * B = 12, and then after multiplying with C = 5, it becomes 60
